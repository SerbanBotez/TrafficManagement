Torch can also be installed using the official guide:
https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

The following command was used on the PyCharm terminal:
`pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113`

If another IDE is used, the `venv` should be activated before running the command above. 
This will cause the torch packages to be installed locally in the activated `venv` and not as global python packages
